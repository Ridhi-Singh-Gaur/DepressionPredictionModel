This model predicts whether a person has depression or not. It gives it's prediction in two forms 0 and 1.
0 means No depression and 1 means depression exists in that person.
This Machine Learning Model has been made through various classification algorithms like Random Forest, K-Nearest-Neighbors, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.                                    
Achieved a maximum accuracy of 94.92% from algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression.
